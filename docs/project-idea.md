# Virtuoso: Project Idea and Purpose

Virtuoso is a desktop application designed to help developers and testers interact with XMPP servers, similar to how Postman is used for REST APIs. The tool enables users to connect as multiple XMPP clients, send custom XML stanzas, and view responses in real time. This streamlines the process of testing, debugging, and developing XMPP-based systems.

**Purpose:**
- Simplify XMPP message testing and debugging.
- Support multi-account scenarios for end-to-end message flow.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for manual and automated XMPP testing.

**Target Users:**
- XMPP developers
- QA engineers
- System integrators
